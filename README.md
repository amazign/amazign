## Hi ðŸ‘‹
## I'm currently using Github to host files and programs for my 2024/25 BTYS Project.
## I'm attempting to make an easy to use public transport app in Ireland, looking at the following areas:
## Intuitiveness - I want the app to be appproachable and easy to learn, while meintaining functionality.
## Intigration - The main goal for this app is to intigrate different types of public transport under one app.
## Inteligience - I want the app to be able to learn and cater to the users needs, e.g. wheelchair users and cyclists.
##
## I look forward to presenting this project in the RDS, and if you want to chat about it don't hesitate to get in touch.
